## Resource Introduction: ADK-Toolbox-Agent Project

Welcome to this course on building sophisticated AI agents. This program is centered around a practical, hands-on project repository, **`adk-toolbox-agent`**, which serves as our primary resource.


### About This Resource

This repository is a collection of code, examples, and notebooks designed to teach the principles of building AI agents using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

The Google ADK is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents. It is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing developers to create complex, multi-agent systems that can interact with various tools and APIs to perform complex tasks.

The `adk-toolbox-agent` project specifically focuses on equipping agents with a "toolbox" of capabilities, enabling them to interact with external systems, process data, and execute complex workflows.

### Course Structure

It is important to note that the foundational material for this course is contained within the **first three (3) notebooks** in this repository. These notebooks will guide you through the core concepts, from setting up your first agent to integrating tools and managing agent interactions.

We recommend you begin by cloning the repository and exploring these initial three notebooks to get started.
